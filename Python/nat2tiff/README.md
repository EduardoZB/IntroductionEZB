# .nat To .tiff converter

The files with ".nat" extension are the native file format of the Meteosat Geostationary satellites. In order to obtain the newest Meteosat images, I found a script by Mr. [Darius A. GÃ¶rgen](https://www.dariusgoergen.com/contents/blog/2020-06-14-nat2tif/index.html) and tweaked it to automate the process from selecting the .nat file to all the individual bandwidth outputs.
