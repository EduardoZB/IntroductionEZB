# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Here is a simple game of **rock, paper, scissors**. The cool thing about it is that the player is not put against random choices, but is faced against an **AI**. For now, it only takes into account the very last match to decide what move to pick, but can be made to completely characterize a player to try and win every time.
So, where's the fun in just looking at some code? Luckily, I'm providing this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nGsyHH4cwaOUN0qnTh44yCracrIyrxED?usp=sharing) to the **colab** file so anyone can play the game and, if desired, can mail the playlog file back to me. That way I can develop a better, tougher and meaner **AI** (yes, I'll be careful with it).

I really hope you enjoy my game and, as always, tips and recommendations are much appreciated.
