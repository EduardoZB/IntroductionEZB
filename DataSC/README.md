# Data Science with Jupyter Notebook

This file is written in Python, uses Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries and is presented in a Notebook. Here I perform a data analysis to the 2021 accident statistics of Spain.

As I upload this for showcasing my coding and data science skills, I'm also providing a [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HcWkuOq667irmGc3QWyhuaE5naS3cS2T/view?usp=sharing) to the collab file, that can be run and commented from the browser. That way you don't have to take my word for it and are able to check it out for yourself.

This is the first data science notebook I'm uploading but I plan to load more in the future. Feel free to send me tips and reccomendations.
