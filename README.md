# IntroductionEZB
Here I showcase some relevant coding skills I've developed over the years. As we live in the age of communication, I've learned to take advantage of the near-infinite ammount of information the internet can provide. Because of that, this is not only a portfolio, but a way to give back to the community of developers that has given me so much.

# Python

For starters, I'll like to show the simplest game I've coded, that also helps developing a rudimentary AI to play against. Thanks to the magic of GitHub, you can now download and play [RockPaperScissors](Python) from your home computer.

# DataSC

**Data science** is an important discipline in the job market today, and learning it is almost compulsory for anyone interested in developing a career in IT. In [this notebook](DataSC) I show just a little of what data science is about.

# Plots

Obtaining, cleaning and managing data is essential for having good insight in the matter. Once that is out of the way comes the need to communicate said insights. Good data visualization skills can help highlighting the most relevant bits of information obtained in a data analysis. In [this section](Plots) you can find some useful plotting scripts that may help saving you some time visualizing the data.
